AICTE-CISCO Virtual Internship Program 2024
Project Components
1. Network Analysis and Mapping
Objective: Analyze the existing campus network to identify the current security controls, including intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and authentication mechanisms.
Tools Used: Cisco Packet Tracer for network topology visualization and mapping.

2. Attack Surface Mapping
Objective: Conduct a comprehensive attack surface mapping to identify potential vulnerabilities and propose effective countermeasures.
Details: The analysis includes identifying open ports, weak passwords, and outdated firmware, and proposes upgrades to encryption protocols and firewall configurations.

3. Hybrid Working Environment
Objective: Design and architect a secure hybrid working environment for faculty and students that ensures secure access both on-campus and remotely.
Solutions Proposed: Implementation of VPNs, Network Access Control (NAC), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB).

4. Content Access Restriction
Objective: Develop a network solution that restricts access to non-educational websites and ensures that only approved web content is accessible by students.
Technology Used: Deployment of Cisco Umbrella for DNS filtering and Cisco Firepower for enhanced firewall protection.
